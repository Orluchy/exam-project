# Exam Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple HTML-based landing page on an AWS EC2 instance with Nginx as the web server and secure it with HTTPS using Certbot. A domain from No-IP was used to link the Elastic IP to a custom subdomain.

## Features
- A landing page with the project-overview, bio, tech journey, and goals.
- Hosted on an Nginx web server.
- Custom subdomain linked through [No-IP](https://no-ip.com).
- Secured with HTTPS using Certbot.
  
## Deployment Instructions
Follow these steps to deploy the web application:

### 1. Provisioning the Server
#### Platform: AWS
- Log into the AWS Management Console.
- Launch a ```t2.micro``` EC2 instance using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the AMI.

#### Key Pair:
- Create and download a ```.pem``` key pair for SSH access.

#### Security Group:
- Configure the security group to allow:
  - HTTP (port 80)
  - SSH (port 22)
  - HTTPS (port 443)

#### Elastic IP:
- Allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with the EC2 instance.

### 2. Setting Up the Web Server

#### SSH Access:
Using the ```.pem``` key you can ssh into the instance, however, i connected to mine using EC2 Instance Connect.

- Connect to the EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect.

#### Update and Install Nginx:
- Update the package manager:
  ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```

- Install Nginx:
  ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
- Start and enable Nginx to run at startup:
  ```
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
  ```
- Ensure that Nginx is running properly:
  ``` 
     sudo systemctl status nginx
  ```
You should see a message indicating that Nginx is active and running. Once Nginx is up and running, you can access your serverâ€™s elastic IP in a browser. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.

### 3. Deploy the HTML page
#### Navigate to Nginx's Web Directory
Now there are different ways to get your HTML page on the server, however, since we are deploying a simple landing page, you can copy and paste your HTML content into a new file using a text editor like nano.

- Firstly, Nginx serves content from the ```/var/www/html``` directory. We'll place your HTML page in this directory.
```
cd /var/www/html
```

- Paste your HTML file While in /var/www/html paste your HTML content and then save (Ctrl+O) and exit (Ctrl+X).
```
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
```

- Set permissions: Ensure that the index.html file has the correct permissions so that Nginx can serve it:
```
     sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/index.html
     sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
```

- Check Your Website In your browser, go to the public IP address of your EC2 instance to confirm that your HTML page is being served.

### 4. Obtaining a free domain from No-IP
#### Registration

## Public Access
My landing page is publicly accessible via the custom subdomain:

https://orluchycloud.ddns.net
